Another great comics project from DNSimple:

> Have you ever wondered why a green lock icon appears on your browser URL bar? And why is it important? We did too, and this comic is for you!

> Follow the adventures of Certificat, Browserbird, and Compugter as they explain why HTTPS is crucial for the future of the web and how it all works together.

> Don't let the bad crabs get you (you'll know what we mean in the comic). Get to know HTTPS and why it is essential to your privacy.
